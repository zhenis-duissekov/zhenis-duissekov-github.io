Hello there! My name is Zhenis Duissekov and I'm a Backend Developer with expertise in Golang, Python, and NodeJS. I'm passionate about creating efficient and scalable systems using microservice and monolith architectures. I have experience with various databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and ClickHouse, and I'm well-versed in technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD.

Currently, I work at Beeline Kazakhstan and I'm contributing to a product that follows microservice architecture principles with over 30 services and 400+ endpoints. My contributions to the product include introducing open telemetry using Jaeger, refactoring a critical system, implementing a product monitoring system, integrating ClickHouse and Kafka as a logging system, increasing test coverage, and migrating critical tables with minimal downtime.

Previously, I co-founded a SAAS startup where we implemented monitoring systems for various sectors and provided software customization to maximize customer benefits. Our COVID monitoring product even assisted the city mayor in avoiding overwhelming the emergency department with extra work.

I'm a graduate of the University of Southern California, where I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, where I earned my MS in Electrical Engineering. In my free time, I enjoy programming, learning new skills, and playing basketball.

Please feel free to contact me via email or through my LinkedIn, Github, or LeetCode profiles. I look forward to hearing from you!
