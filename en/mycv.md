## Work Experience

### Beeline Kazakhstan

#### Backend Developer

At Beeline Kazakhstan, I've been working on a product with over 30 services and more than 400 endpoints. Here are some of my contributions:

- Introducing open telemetry using Jaeger to critical services, which has greatly improved the maintainability of the product.
- Refactoring a critical system that reduced the wait time from 30 minutes to 1-2 minutes, leading to increased sales.
- Implementing a product monitoring system that gathers, visualizes, and smartly alerts on critical events, which is continuously utilized.
- Integrating ClickHouse and Kafka as a logging system that generates around 1,000,000 logs per day and provides additional analytics tools for the team.
- Installing SonarQube and including services to detect security hotspots and bugs.
- Increasing test coverage by implementing new tests from 32% to 46% of the total 32K lines of code.
- Migrating critical tables with minimal downtime for business purposes.
- Maintaining up-to-date documentation and swagger.
- Creating a monthly payment system service.

### BAIOL (startup)

#### Co-founder, Developer

At BAIOL, I co-founded a startup that implemented monitoring systems for various sectors such as finance, management, oil/gas, medicine, education, and social services. Our COVID monitoring product assisted the city mayor in avoiding overwhelming the emergency department with extra work.

### Patentes Talgo S.L.

#### Electrical Engineer

At Patentes Talgo S.L., I conducted maintenance and repairs on electrical and electronic equipment onboard a train and programmed PLCs. I also temporarily served as the chief of base and led a team of approximately 120 workers for 6 months.
